## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on historical video game sales data (1980-2016). The goal is to identify patterns that determine a game's success to support the **Ice online store** in planning its advertising budget for 2017.

## 🎯 Main Objectives
* **Life Cycle Analysis:** Identify which platforms are growing or shrinking.
* **Sales Drivers:** Analyze how critic and user reviews impact sales across different genres.
* **Regional Profiling:** Determine the top platforms and genres for North America (NA), Europe (EU), and Japan (JP).
* **Hypothesis Testing:** Statistically test if user ratings differ between platforms and genres.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Skills
* **Data Manipulation:** `Pandas`, `NumPy`.
* **Data Visualization:** `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`.
* **Statistical Analysis:** `Scipy.stats` (T-tests).
* **Environment Management:** `Conda` / `Pip`.

## 📁 Project Structure
* `datasets/`: Raw data used for the analysis.
* `notebook.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the full analysis and conclusions.
* `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies to reproduce the environment.
